This really should have been posted a week ago, but nonetheless. My thoughts on seeing Edelman win Super Bowl MVP. 

As a Toronto sports fan, I have been lucky enough to have Boston sports teams destroy my beloved Blue Jays and Maple Leafs on a regular basis the past decade. Somehow, 12 year old me knew how I much I would come to love watching this in the future and decided to devote my allegiance to the Miami Dolphins when I started watching the NFL (Big Ricky Williams and Chris Chambers guy). So when I watched Julian Edleman stand up there with that MVP trophy on Sunday a couple things ran through my mind: Fuck I’ll never be able to grow a beard like that, at least it isn’t Brady again and most prominently is that Dustin Pedroia? 
	

When I think of Boston sports I think of all the championships they have won over the past 20 years and I think of the types of players on those teams. Aggressive, tough, hard nosed style of guys from appearance right down to the way they play the game. When I think of certain teams’ guys just automatically come to mind. For the Red Sox you had guys like Dustin Pedroia, Jason Varitek and David Ortiz. Milan Lucic will forever be a Bruin in my mind (plus his career has kind of hit a rough patch after he left), Marchand and Chara. For New England it has always been Brady, Gronk and whoever else is so lucky to get to share the same jersey as them that year. However, at that moment, watching Edelman hoist the MVP trophy he will now be forever engraved into this Toronto sports fans head as a part of this mini, fucked up legends row of Boston athletes that has been forming in my head the past 20 years. If you don’t get the gist. Boston, you’re in my head. I am not sure if my body will be able to handle the number of Xanax it will be enduring should the Maple Leafs play the Bruins again this year in the playoffs. Until then, Boston, Edelman congrats. I hate you.
