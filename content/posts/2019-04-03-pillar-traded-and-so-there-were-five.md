Pillar was never one of my favourite Jays, however I always respected what he brought to the Jays over the past 6 years. Good speed, tremendous leadership and at least a couple weeks a season where his defensive prowess would take over Sportscentre. With the 2015 team largely dismantled by the post Alex Anthopolous regime, some would say that Pillar being traded was only a matter of time. He unfortunately just turned 30 and does not fit the timeline of when this new regime hopes to be competitive again, so he was shipped out of town just a week after his former teammate Morales was given away. This leaves us with just 5 players from the team back in 2015 that took over the city of Toronto when they were playing and led us to two consecutive trips to the ALCS. Stroman, Sanchez, Smoak, Tepera and Travis. 

For when I watch the Jays this year, which, like the rest of Toronto will not be bothered to do this year until the Raptors and Leafs quests for a championship are done. What I will miss most other then the hustle and heart Pillar brings everyday is that seeing that name slotted in the CF slot brings back great memories having a connection to those playoff teams a couple years back. Watching an OF of possibly McKinney, Alford and Pompey in June, while perhaps giving intermittent, exciting glimpses into what the future might bring, will most likely bring a lot of frustration, depression and denial of how it was only 2.5 years ago when times were just as good in October as they are in April in Toronto. 

In return for one of our last veteran leaders, we got three guys that might as well be named Randy, Bob and Mike because I guarantee that 99.9% of the population on the north side of the border have absolutely no idea who they are. Myself included. A quick trip to Google would tell us that Alen Henson is a former top prospect that is now 23 and was designated for assignment 5 days ago by San Francisco. Derek Law is 28, had a good first 55 innings in the majors in 2015 when he had an ERA of 2.13, however since then looks like he has struggled with injuries and inconsistency. Lastly, Juan De Paula who is a lottery ticket, was the number 19 rated prospect in the Giantâ€™s system after recording a 1.72 ERA mostly at Low A ball last year. Furthermore, the main return is that the Jays were looking for a spot where Anthony Alford would finally be given a real chance to play everyday. Similar to what their idea was last week with dealing Morales and giving more at bats to guys like Rowdy Tellez. 

I am sad to see Pillar go as he was a fan favourite and a pillar of stability in centre field over the past 4 seasons where he has taken over the full-time role (sorry had to do it). The remaining 5 guys from that 2015 ALCS team must look around the clubhouse in somewhat disbelief of how fast things have changed from the exhilarating run towards a championship a couple years back and must wonder if they are going to be receiving a call from their agent next.
